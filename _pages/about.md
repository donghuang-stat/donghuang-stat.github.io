I am a second-year Ph. D student at Department of Statistics and Data Science, Tsinghua University, very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Pengkun Yang](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1023/2411.htm).
I obtained my B.S. degree in Mathematics from Department of Mathetical Sciences, Tsinghua University. My research interests are in statistics, probability theory and theoretical computer science.
